# Database-Creation-Using-SQL
In this project, I built a full database from start to finish using MySQL Relational Database Management System. I created the database tables with their columns, mapped the primary and foreign keys, then inserted the table rows. This database is adequate for analysis using queries and can serve as a  model for creating other databases.
